I end up doing a lot of remote work from home after normal business hours, remoting in to my unreliable work Windows
machine from my trusty late-2007 Macbook Pro. Being the unreliable beast that it is, I find myself needing to reboot 
my work machine quite often. Luckily, I can do this right from the comfort of my home.

1.  Open a command prompt as an administrator.
2.  Type `shutdown /i`
3.  In the Remote Shutdown Dialog that opens, add your remote machine name, and select "Restart" from the dropdown labeled
"What do you want these computers to do"
