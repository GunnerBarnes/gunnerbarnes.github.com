**6.6km speed work.**  
Track workout. Planned on doing 1.6km warm-up, 1.2km fast, .4km recovery,
1.6km fast, 1.6km cool-down; side stitch around 5km derailed that plan.
Still, PRs for 5km, 1km, and 1 mile. Didn't feel my fastest. On a good day,
I could probably shatter all of those PRs. Nice quiet night alone on the track,
with just a light sprinkle during my warm-up.
