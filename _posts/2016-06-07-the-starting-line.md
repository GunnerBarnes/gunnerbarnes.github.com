Four years ago, a friend suggested we run a half marathon at the end of the summer. Last May, we finally got around to training for it, and last September we both ran our first half marathon.

Then the running stopped. Running the race felt like such an accomplishment, but the burden of running in the cold was too uncomfortable to bear at the time. It was only for 3 months that I stopped running. It felt much longer. 

This year, I got back into running in February, with a little help from the treadmill some nights, and warm gear for others. I ran my first half marathon of the year in May, and will be starting training in 2 weeks for my first marathon later this year. I plan on keeping a running log this time, so I can track my progress, and I think that making it public will further motivate me to get out there and run. So this is me. This is my journey. Here we go.
