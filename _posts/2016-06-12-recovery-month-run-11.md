**13km long(ish) run.**

Rough run. Bonked halfway through, and should have cut it
short but didn't. 3.5 minutes slower than the week before,
and that one was uphill on Stop 13. Ran without headphones,
but turned feedback on this time. Not sure if that kept me
going or made it harder to hear how slow I was running.
Oh well, bad workouts happen. Just need to get back on track
this final week so marathon training can start out right.
