**5km race.**

Last minute sign up for the Valleycats Home Run 5km at The Joe.
Hot morning, and my stupid gps failed to track on my phone. I
started out at what seemed to be a pretty quick pace, but the heat
got to me around the halfway point. Finished 39th out of 360 though,
and just missed the top 3 in my age group (finished 4th, M30-34).
Missed by exactly one minute. First place in my age group was 20:52.
I'm going to beat that time next year.
