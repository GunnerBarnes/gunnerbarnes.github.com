**9.7km speed workout.**

1.6km warm-up, 2:2 fartleks, 1.6km cool-down.
Good workout, finally took it easy during the warm-up and
cool-down like I should. Slowed a bit around 5km (4:44/km),
but managed to keep most kms under 4:42. Energy level felt
decent; not my best, but enough to put in a decent speed
workout. Nice cool weather (64 degrees)
