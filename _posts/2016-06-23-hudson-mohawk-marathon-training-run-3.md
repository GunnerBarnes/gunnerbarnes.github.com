**8km cool-down.**

Very light workout; legs were depleted from last
night. Early morning run, didn't push at all. Ran a couple
5:00+ kms. Back on track with marathon training now. I'm going to
try to take it easier on all runs other than speed work this time
around. Too often I try to go all out all the time. I think I'm
missing out on some serious benefits, as far as letting my legs
recover goes. This one was tough towards the end.
