**6.4km warm-up.**

Worst run of the year. Everything about the run
sucked. No energy, no strength, no focus, etc.
4.83km easy, 1.6km hard(ish). Seriously, fastest
km was 4:34; and that took every ounce of energy.

+ Distance: 6.43km
+ Pace: 4'52"
+ Elevation: 32m
+ Calories: 535
+ Duration: 31:18
+ Worst Split: 5:01/km (5)
+ Best Split: 4:34/km (6)
