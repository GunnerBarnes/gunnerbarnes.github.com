**16.1km long run.**

First long run of training, and first double-digit mileage
since the Steel Rail Half. Really trying to focus on running
my long runs at a much slower pace this time around. I think
I pushed to hard during the half marathon training on my long
runs, and maybe that's part of what's causing my possible
muscle fatigue now.

Didn't feel like I was running hard at all, but I ran a very
consistent pace. After the first 2-3kms, the average pace feedback
stayed within a second or two over every single km (pretty consistently
5:18/km). It was a hot day, so I ran around 7pm, after the sun had
gone mostly below the trees. Humidity was still high, temps too around
84 degrees. Good first long run though.
