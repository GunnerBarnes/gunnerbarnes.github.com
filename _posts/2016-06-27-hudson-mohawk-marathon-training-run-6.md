**6.4km warm-up.**

Same workout distances this week of the plan,
with just the speed and long runs changing focus slightly.
Run was a little tough this morning. This is the 3rd straight
run where my legs just didn't feel there at all. I was able to
keep each km under 5:00 per, but I shouldn't be feeling this
tired from such a short run.

Early morning run before work, to avoid the heat. It was getting
up there by the time I was finishing up. Last mile felt tough,
but I focused on my turnover and shortening my stride, and that
lead to a significant improvement in my pace, with what felt like
only a small amount of extra exertion. That's going to be a very
important factor in the rest of this training cycle.

*Note*: Nike+ messed up the elevation somehow on the second half of the run.
