**9.7km speed work.**

1.6km warm-up, 6.4km steady fast pace, 1.6km cool-down.
Legs felt a little better for once. Humidity absolutely
killed my breathing. Didn't run a frighteningly fast pace,
but compared to recent workouts the speed was decent.
Early morning run before work. Perfectly paced my warm-up
and cool-down miles.
