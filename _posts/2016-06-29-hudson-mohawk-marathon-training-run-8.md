**8km cool-down.**

Rough day, but finally a good run. Ran in the evening,
shortly after dinner. Really felt like I wasn't forcing my mechanics 
in any way towards the end; felt like I was finally getting full 
leg strength. I need to just continue running how I feel comfortable 
running, instead of trying to force myself into a specific running style.
I think that's what's been affecting my pace lately.
