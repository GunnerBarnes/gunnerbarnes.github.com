**11.2km maintenance.**

Evening run, after a big roast beef dinner. I really need to stop running
right after dinner. Low humidity and reasonable temperature made the run
enjoyable though. Shoes definitely need to be replaced before Saturday.
Ran the opposite direction of yesterday (up the Stop 13 "Hill that Kills", without stopping)
