**25.7km long run.**

Hardest run ever. Started much too late (10am), temperature was
already unbearable. Made it about 8km before I needed to take a
break, then needed a break almost every 2km that. Took
a slightly longer break at 14km to rehydrate. Last 11km were very
painful, fighting dehydration the entire time. That's what I get for
breaking my "don't start a long run after 7am in the summer" rule.
