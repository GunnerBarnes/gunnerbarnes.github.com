**25.7km long run.**

Much better than last weekend. Started nice and early at 6:30,
and was done before 9. First time using a hydration belt, and it
made a huge difference. Two 10oz bottles, with a 7:3 powerade-to-water
mix, and I froze one of them so it would maybe be cold for the second half.
Didn't take a single break throughout the run. Knees started to feel a little sore
towards the end (last 5 km), but leg strength was steady throughout. Overall pace
was a bit slower than last weekend, but I was able to finish stronger than I started,
and run continuously this time.
