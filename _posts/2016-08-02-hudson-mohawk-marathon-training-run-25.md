**5.23km intervals!**

1.6 km up, .8 km full speed, .4 km slower, .8 km full speed, 1.6 km down.
First intervals in a long time. Nice cool night for it too.
Started with a nice warm-up pace, a little bit faster than I've
been running lately. I need to work on that; my comfortable pace is a
little too comfortable lately. Not as fast as the last time I did interval
work, but still a respectable workout.
