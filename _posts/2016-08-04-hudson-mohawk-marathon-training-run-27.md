**12.8km maintenance.**

My "comfortable pace" seems to be getting slower and slower as
training progresses. I want to work on getting back down to a
sub-5 minute km average. I've gotten there a few times, especially
during speed work, but at this point I'm almost as slow as I was in March
when my last training schedule started. I should be at least in the 7:40 range.

The first half of this run was tough. I felt very slow, despite what
seemed to be good mechanics. Splits were all above 5:14 (with one at 5:40).
The second half was significantly better, and I didn't feel like I changed
very much at all. I felt more like I was running, and less like I was just
moving my feet. All second half splits were below 5:20, with two below 5:00.
That's the running I need to be doing consistently.
