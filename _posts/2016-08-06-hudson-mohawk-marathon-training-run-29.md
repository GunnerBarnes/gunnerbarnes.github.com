**28.9km long run.**

Tough run. Started out comfortably, with a light sprinkle for the
first two miles. First half kilometer didn't track, so my total distance
was just a bit longer than stated here. First half of the run felt great,
up until the point where I turned around during last week's long run. I had
to go out 1 mile further from there, and somehow found the hilliest route I
could have taken. Humidity was heavy too, so I had to take a few breaks, with
the first one coming at the halfway point. Still felt good after 10 miles, but
by the 13 mile mark, I knew I was out of gas. The last 5 miles included many breaks.

For the next long run like this, I'm going to fill my hydration belt with just water,
and carry gels, or a powerade. I was definitely a little dehydrated by the time I finished.
Lots of room to improve, but I know that I can. This reminded me of my first 16 mile run;
I was unprepared (despite preparing), but with a little planning, the next one will be a huge
improvement.
