**6.44km warm-up.**

Had to drop the car off at the shop, which just so happened
to be 5 miles away. Added the extra distance to the run, but
at a very conservative pace. This was a tough run; I think my
shoes may be causing some Extensor Tendonitis. I may take a few
days off, or switch up to an older pair of shoes. Left foot hurts
a lot, and right knee is locking up a bit. I really feel like I've
lost a lot of muscle mass too; I feel like I have so little strength
in my legs. I guess some slowdown and soreness should be expected
though after Saturday's run. I'm honestly a bit surprised that I was
able to run at all.
