**8km maintenance.**

Took a week off from training, for numerous reasons. I'll get
back into it next week, but I needed this break more than I
thought I did. Just a casual run to the garage to pick up my car.
Humidity was awful, even at 7:30 am. Shin splints were terrible for
the first half of the run. A few more days off, then back at it.
I'm going to need a long break after this marathon.
