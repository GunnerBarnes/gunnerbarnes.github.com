**12.87km maintenance run.**

First run since Saturday, and longest run since the 18-miler.
I ran without any headphones or music, mostly because my right
ear has been bothering me. I also turned off all feedback, aside
from halfway and completion. For the first time in a long time, I
felt like I was running instead of just moving my legs. Every step was
powerful, and purposeful. I didn't feel any soreness, or fatigue at any
point. I've lost all gains I made in pace since March, but I'm okay with
starting over with that if it means that running will feel good again.

Of note: exactly one year ago, I hit the 1,000km mark in Nike+. By the
middle of next week, I will hit the 2,500km mark. It took me 4 years to
reach the 1,000km mark. Considering that over a six-month span from September
to the end of February I only ran a combined 261km, it's been a good year
of running. Next year, I'm hoping to double what I've done up until now.
