**8.05km warm-up.**

Good morning run, with a surprisingly good pace. Didn't
feel like I was going as fast as I actually was. Legs felt good,
breathing was decent, and I was able to give a little more
effort for the last mile. It was really nice to see that last km
down at the lower end of the 4:00/km range. Skipped yesterday's
workout, but may try to get it in either tonight or Sunday,
depending on timing.
