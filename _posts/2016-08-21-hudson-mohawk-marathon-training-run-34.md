**25.75km long run.**

First long run in a few weeks. Ran with Bill, his first
16 miler. Very slow, relaxed pace. Felt good for the first 3/4,
but really ran out of gas towards the end. Knees felt a little
sore by the end. Left foot is still an issue; definitely still
dealing with either extensor tendonitis or a possible stress
fracture. I'll try to be mindful of it this week. Expected to
finish around 2:40:00, so pretty good pace/time estimating.
