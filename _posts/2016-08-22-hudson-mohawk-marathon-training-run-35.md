**8.05km warm-up.**

First run with Jack!
Nice cool night, and a nice slow pace (thanks to a heavy
stroller) to recover from yesterday's 16-miler. Jack slept
the whole time, and I felt like the run was over so quickly.
I was so focused on him that I almost forgot I was running.

Nike Plus decided to update their app today, and thankfully I
had disabled auto-updates. I guess a lot of people lost their
training schedules.
