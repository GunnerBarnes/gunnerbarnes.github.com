**19.31km speed work.**

1.6km warm-up, 16km at marathon pace, 1.6km cool-down.

I think this was the longest speed work run I've done
to date. Got out nice and early, before the temperature even got
back to 60 degrees. Run felt good right from the start. First km
was barely over 5:00, and the majority of my kms were under 5:00.
I didn't feel like I was pushing as hard as I could have, but I've
been working on my expectations for the marathon, and think that a
5:00/km pace is a reasonable goal. I'd certainly love to run a pace
faster than my last half marathon (4:45/km), but with all the running
I've done this year, I don't know that my body is capable of making
those gains without incurring some damage.

One more workout like this during peak week, but that will be the last
long speed workout.
