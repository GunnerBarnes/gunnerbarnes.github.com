**8.05km maintenance.**

Skipped yesterday's 12.8km maintenance run; my body was
telling me it needed more rest.

Good early morning run. Started off at a pace that I'm happy
with, considering how much I had been struggling early on in the
month. I was really able to push a little bit more over the last
3km, running negative splits all under a 4:45/km pace (4:41, 4:34, 4:21).
The best part was that I didn't feel like I was pushing that much.
