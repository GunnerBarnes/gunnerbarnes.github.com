**32.19km long run.**

Longest run to date. Skipped Friday's warm-up workout, and
pushed this off from Saturday so I could get some yard work
done. Ran with Bill again, but at a slightly faster pace than
last time (~22 sec/km). First 20km felt great. The rest of the
run was a bit tougher, but nowhere near as exhausting as last
weekend. Was hoping to finish right around the 3 hour mark, and
went just a little over. This run put me over the 2,500km mark
in Nike+.
