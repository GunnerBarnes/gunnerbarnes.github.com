**8.05km warm-up.**

Dropped the car off at the garage bright and early, and
ran home. Started at a very slow pace, close to what I ran
over the weekend on my long run. Average pace went down from
there, over each km. Started at 5:43/km, ended with an average of
5:12/km, on a fairly hilly route. Good way to start the week.
