**5.2km speed work.**

1.6km warm-up, .8km all-out, .4km jog, .8km all-out, 1.6km cool-down.

Second workout of the day.
Didn't have time to get to the track for this week's
intervals workout, so my pace was not as fast as it
could have been. Still, I'm very happy with the results.
Felt good right from the start, and I felt like I was able
to push a bit more than usual during the intervals. Very briefly saw
my pace hit 3:39/km, which is more than 10 seconds faster than
I've ever hit. With more work, I think I could maintain a 4:00/km pace.
