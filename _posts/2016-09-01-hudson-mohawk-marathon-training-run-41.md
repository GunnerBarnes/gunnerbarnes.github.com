**12.87km maintenance.**

Good morning maintenance run before work. Started to tire
around the midway point, but felt strong for the second half
and ended up running negative splits over the last 7 km. Was
able to keep my pace under the 5:00/km level too, once again.
I'm starting to get some of my speed back, I think I just got
a little tired from all the training.
