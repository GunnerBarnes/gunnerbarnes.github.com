**32.19km long run.**

Second 20-miler with Bill.
Much better than last weekend. After the first 8 miles,
we discussed changing up our route to avoid the nasty
hills we usually include. We did so, and we ended up running
two 4ish mile loops over a relatively flat area. There was
very little shade on the route, but fortunately for us it was a
much cooler day than usual. Finished in under 3 hours, which has
me thinking a sub-3:30 marathon is still possible (8 s/km faster than last week).
