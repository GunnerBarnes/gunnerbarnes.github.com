**16.1km speed work.**

1.6km up, 12.8km progression, 1.6km down.

I'm usually pretty bad at progression runs. I start out far too
fast, leaving little room for actual progress. Today I set out with a
plan though. I had a rough idea what my first km pace would be given that
I skipped yesterday's warm-up (NOTE TO SELF: don't do this again). My goal
was to aim for a 5 second increase per km. I expected to start around 5:40/km,
which would have me finishing around 4:30/km.

My new trick to get myself running faster is to calculate my next split time in
my head and give myself a target range to shoot for. It somehow helps me to not
over-focus on my running form, and make more reasonable, modest gains in pace.
I started out at 5:35/km, and by the halfway point I was down to 4:47/km. I lost a
little bit of steam after that - skipping breakfast was a poor choice - but still
managed to keep most of my splits in the lower 4:40/km range.
